## Getting And Cleaning Data

# Raw data

The script assumes the raw data is downloaded and unzipped in <wd>/rawdata. Such that for example
'X_test.txt' is located at <wd>/rawdata/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt.
When the script is loaded using source(paste(getwd(), "run_analysis.R", sep = "/")) it will automatically load and process the raw data.
